<h1 style="text-align: center;">Monero i2p Mining Pool</h1>
<p>Sure, some say that mining on i2p is downright foolish due to the lag. I.e., you could have found a block, but by the time that information gets to the mining pool someone else already found it. But who knows - maybe you really&nbsp;value your privacy but still want to mine monero. So, here's a monero mining pool for i2p.</p>
<p>Its assumed at this point that you know how to setup a client i2p tunnel, but I will eventually make a how-to page. Here are the tunnels for the mining ports:</p>
<p><strong>Low Difficulty Port</strong> - starts at 100 difficulty</p>
<p>kntwqaxyl7su3ollcd5l33j3rrmcpjhsr4zjj65q4n3cjq3kbm4q.b32.i2p</p>
<div><strong>High Difficulty Port</strong> - starts at 10000 difficulty</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>bei2cfeir2k4xsn5rcknguw3m3kik5mfggkoxc4pv43aqvpbovja.b32.i2p</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>(if you're unsure, just start with low diff - the pool will automatically adjust)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Fees - I've made the fees 5% for me, and 2% for i2p donation, and 0.1% for monero core, and 0.1 for the developer of the pool software.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The original pool code frontend is all javascript bloated and involves an API, so I've tried to make something that is compatible with i2p. Its not nearly as nice as the original - as you can't enter your address and get your stats. Hopefully I'll eventually figure out how to do that with a status page. For now, here are the live stats.&nbsp;</div>
